When a normal click on any RMA orders from the list, a new window will open which shows all the details of return request from a customer. Here the status of an order is ‘Waiting for Approval’ that means the further action will be taken by admin-level user.


Admin user handles the rest of the process from Odoo and a normal user gets notified once the particular order is approved.


A normal user can download the whole order as shown. Furthermore, a user can jump between orders from arrows button placed on the centre top.
