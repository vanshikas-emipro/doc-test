### Create Return Request from Odoo Website



After successful installation of Website RMA, a ‘Return Order’ button will appear on the sales order portal for the products which are successfully shipped to the customer.


By default, it is not provided in the eCommerce/Website App in Odoo.


When a customer clicks on that button, a confirmation dialogue box will pop-out.

When the **Confirm** button is clicked, an RMA request form of the particular sales order will appear for a customer in which all the product details bought by the customer will be shown. Here, a customer can select Return Reason, enter the number of Quantity to Return and can write Return Note if there is any.
